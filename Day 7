A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

class Solution(object):
    def isPalindrome(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        # Filter only alphanumeric characters and convert to lowercase
        filtered = ''.join(char.lower() for char in s if char.isalnum())
        
        # Check if the filtered string is equal to its reverse
        return filtered == filtered[::-1]
